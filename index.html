                              <p>You might not have heard of them, but Westfund has been around for more than six decades with origins dating back to 1881.They have over 110,000 members, and are one of Australia's 
                                fastest growing funds. But there are a number of other key benefits that come with being a Westfund member, which we think you might want to know about:</p>
                              <ul class="westfundOrange">
                                <li><strong>Get more back.</strong> As a not-for-profit health fund, Wesfund focuses on keeping premiums low and paying benefits back to their members. Did you know that 89c in every dollar of premiums goes back to members?</li>
                                <li><strong>Easy to switch. </strong> You don't need to re-serve any waiting periods when you transfer to an equivalent or lower level of cover. Plus, Westfund offers a 30-day guarantee meaning you can try them for 30 days, and if you decide to cancel, they'll refund any premiums paid - as long as no claims are made.</li>
                                <li><strong>Our Local Care Centre </strong> is in Maroochydore if you want to talk to someone face to face. Or we have 3 Contact Centres in NSW and QLD.</li>
